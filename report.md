# Automatic Index Creation for PostgreSQL Based on Relation Scans

### Submitted BY

## Motivation
In PostgreSQL, full relation scans can be inefficient, especially when an index could significantly speed up query execution. However, creating indexes manually can be cumbersome and requires a deep understanding of the database schema and query patterns. Automating the index creation process can optimize query performance without requiring manual intervention, making the database more efficient and user-friendly.
